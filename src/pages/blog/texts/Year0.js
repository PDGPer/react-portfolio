                You stand at the edge of a great forest. It stretches out into
                the horizon, seemingly never-ending. Every few paces there is a
                plaque hanging from a branch. They are of every shape and
                material imaginable, same for their lettering. They are however
                almost identical in their message: "Learn to code!" â€” if not for
                the fact that some have spelling errors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Underneath each plaque there is a path. Some look half decent,
                others seem abandoned and almost completely obstructed by
                vegetation. You have no idea where each leads. Somehow you have
                to get to the other side of the forest.
            </p>
            <p>
                If my tale is to be of any help to you then you are, like me, a
                self-learner. Chance has brought you to the same point in space
                that I once occupied. Consider this text the equivalent of a
                bunch of loose papers nailed to a pine tree at the edge of the
                forest. I have made my way back from the other side of the
                frontend (FE) web development path and left this here, in the
                hope that it might help another clueless traveller such as I
                once was.

                First, take heart. You already carry some of the tools that will
                serve you well. Since you are reading this, it's safe to assume
                you already have some command of the English language. If that
                command is fragile, you should seek to improve it. It is an
                unavoidable fact that certain languages, through historical
                chance, lay claim to the knowledge produced during the apex of a
                given region of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                At some point in time, you had to be versed in Greek to become a
                philosopher, in Latin to become a theologian, or in Italian to
                be an artist. The age of coal and iron alchemy made English the{" "}
                <em>lingua franca</em> of engineering and we are all stuck with
                it for our coding needs for the foreseeable future.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know that there are ever more learning materials in other
                languages, and that might suffice at the beginning of your
                travels. But what about after? Many projects are only documented
                in English. You will probably have to communicate with
                multinational teams with precision, since building code is a
                precise affair. You will have to write your own documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sorry, we are all condemned to it. Inside that forest, they
                don't speak much else. Unless you're prepared to always be
                second banana to the people who will do the talking for you,
                restricting your ability to find the best opportunities and do
                your best work.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've never had much trouble with English, having been exposed to
                it from a young age, but here is some of the stuff I found
                useful for improving it or learning other languages from
                scratch.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a bumbling novice, use apps like Duolingo and read some fun
                but accessible books originally written in English. Try to find
                people to converse with casually in the language, ideally in
                real life. Otherwise you can try apps like Tandem. As you study,
                take notes in English and have ChatGPT proofread them. Change
                all your system and app settings to English. Boot up Spotify and
                belt out some karaoke.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you get to a good level of fluency and want to fine tune your
                accent, start shadow training by recording yourself repeating
                movie dialogues phrase by phrase and then listening back to pin
                down where the problems are. If you're a native speaker of a
                romance language like me, your main enemies will almost
                certainly be the 'w' and 'th' sounds, which is something I never
                realized until I started shadow training.
            </p>
            <p>You will be a natural in no time.</p>
            <p>
                What else have you got in your bag? Is that some 'maths' residue
                I see in there? Don't worry, if you're just learning FE web dev,
                it will probably suffice for now. It would be a different matter
                if you were learning Machine Learning and other such dark
                magics. But even a mediocre math student such as myself could
                make do with whatever was still bouncing around in my noggin two
                decades removed from learning it in high school. So no worries
                about needing to be a mathlord to learn code. Any concepts you
                might still be missing won't be too hard to pick up as you come
                across them.
            </p>
            <p>
                And what else do I see you carrying? No, not in the bag. In you.
                Why, it's the irrepressible human spirit to learn and overcome.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this is your first trip to the forest of self-learning, you
                can harbour some doubts about your ability to traverse it. Don't
                worry about it. Just focus on the fact that it is indeed
                traversable. It's simple geography. Every kind of terrain is
                delimited. So there is an exit, 100%. Sometimes you might wish
                you had a better sense of navigation, a map or a guide. With
                luck, you will find some of those things. But all of them are
                accessory. Step into the path knowing you will sometimes be lost
                and confused. In such cases, step back, consider your situation,
                make new plans and always keep in mind that the exit from the
                forest exists physically somewhere, which means you will find it
                eventually.
            </p>
            <p>
                So let's get into it. Even if you know nothing else, you
                probably know you have to start with the big three: HTML, CSS &
                JS. I usually use a book making analogy to explain them to
                people who know nothing about tech. HTML is the actual content
                of the book, such as text, images, tables and so on. CSS is how
                those things are shown in the book: fonts, pagination, cover
                material, paper type, colours, etc. Think about how a technical
                manual and a children's storybook look completely different. You
                still could, as part of some kind of over-elaborate prank,
                switch the contents and keep the style. That is the sort of
                thing that CSS facilitates. Finally, JS is like a pencil and
                eraser you can use to rewrite and restyle the book on the fly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here I must confess a lack of specific advice on which path to
                take to start your journey into the forest. Truth is, learning
                the basics of HTML is not that hard and I already had a decent
                grasp of CSS from customizing Wordpress themes when I got it
                into my head to learn how to code. Not to say it was easy as a
                whole. I was still utterly lost. I had no friendly guide or even
                a map roughly sketched on a piece of bark. So I did the
                equivalent of picking a path that looked well-worn: I bought a
                Coursera subscription. Most of the stuff I learned from it was
                decent enough, but it also taught me a few lessons absent from
                the syllabus.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first one is to always look at the expiry date. A lot of
                courses out there only get updated infrequently, if at all.
                However, the webdev portion of the forest is ever shifting and
                changing, especially in all things related to JS. Assume that
                everything that gets past the one year mark without updates is
                horribly outdated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whatever you pick for learning CSS, it's a big plus if it also
                covers the subject matter of responsive design. A little info
                about accessibility is also nice to have. And just because I
                paid for my course like a chump doesn't mean you have to. There
                are a lot of good free materials out there. A lot of crap too,
                which the paid services sometimes help filter out.
            </p>
            <p>
                So here is another lesson. To be seen as an educator in the
                webdev milieu is a way to boost your chances of employability or
                an opportunity to sell magic beans in the shape of overpriced
                advice which usually consists of stuff they got third hand from
                other Twitter entrepreneurs. Even barely out of the egg chicks
                you meet along the path will try to convince they can teach you
                how to fly as a form of "fake it 'till you make it". How do you
                tell them apart from the wise owls?
            </p>
            <p>
                Pay attention to your progress. Are you learning? Do you feel
                your command over the material increasing? That things are
                clicking into place? Good learning materials feel challenging,
                but never confusing. If you start to feel lost with no sense of
                what you are supposed to be doing, they are probably bad.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, you might also need something different in terms
                of approach. Some people love to follow along with videos.
                Others are dutiful note takers. Personally, videos bore me and
                all my attempts at being a notes guy end with piles of copious
                notes that I will never look at again, no matter how organized I
                make them.
            </p>
            <p>
                My personal style is to carefully read up on a subject and then
                build challenging projects of my own devising, forcing me to
                internalize what I've learned. This is also how I learned most
                of my major skills, even before coding. Find what works for you.
                There is so much stuff out there that it's impossible not to
                eventually stumble onto something tailor made for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another problem that the "entrepreneur" ecosystem generates is
                that information gets fragmented. People just throw up lessons
                on random subjects as a means to have content for the social
                media maw. Look for materials that are structured and
                comprehensive, with a logical start and end point on the way to
                teach a subject. That at least shows that the author is making
                an effort to actually teach and not just clout chase.
            </p>
            <p>
                So let's get back into practicalities. You've somehow tackled
                HTML and CSS despite my terrible advice. Next is JS, and it's a
                big step up in terms of difficulty.
            </p>
            <p>
                I began by trying to follow{" "}
                <a
                    href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noreferrer"
                >
                    freeCodeCamp's curriculum
                </a>{" "}
                but found that it assumes too many leaps of knowledge and relies
                on pre-built scenarios where you can progress well enough at
                first without really understanding what is actually going on.
                Eventually you hit a wall and get stuck, confused and wondering
                if you're dumb.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't think this problem is exclusive to fCC, by the way. A
                lot of learning materials are made by people who know a lot
                about a given subject, and probably have known it for so long
                that they've forgotten all the stepping stones that must be
                included to teach a certain subject to novices. In their mind
                such things are unconsciously filed under "everyone knows that",
                and skipped. But people can get stuck on the minutest of things
                and discouraged. It's only with the greatest of teachers that
                you get a constant consideration for what is going on in the
                mind of the students so that no possible doubt can sneak by
                unexamined.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fumbling around for alternatives, I followed a friend's advice
                to look at{" "}
                <a
                    href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noreferrer"
                >
                    Asabeneh's 30 Days of JS
                </a>
                . It consists of a bunch of humble markdowns hosted on Github.
                The text has spelling errors the author said he doesn't care
                about. They were a reminder not to judge books by their covers
                and a blessing from the forest gods. Asabeneh's lessons cracked
                the basics of JS for me like a ripe melon. After getting through
                it, I got back to the fCC course materials and found them to be
                a breeze. Now everything clicked. This, by the way, became my
                preferred way of using the fCC courses, as a test of knowledge
                instead of a learning material.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point I started to feel slightly lost again. I had some
                command of the big three and kept practising my JS with stuff
                like{" "}
                <a
                    href="https://www.codewars.com/"
                    target="_blank"

                >
                    Codewars
                </a>
                , but didn't have a clear idea of where to proceed to next. It
                was also obvious that this knowledge alone wouldn't be enough to
                get a job. Feeling a bit despondent, I started looking for
                people who had gone through the same process, hoping to get some
                pointers.
            </p>
            <p>
                My search ended up wielding extremely lucky results. I chanced
                upon a particularly friendly frontend sage who had also pivoted
                to code later in life,{" "}
                <a
                    href="https://eduardovedes.com/"
                    target="_blank"

                    Eduardo Vedes
                </a>
                . No only did he write back a very helpful reply, but also
                offered to mentor me. Though typically a mentor will also help
                you with particular technical matters, their real value is in
                helping you find the shortest route out of the forest and into
                the place where you want to be. After all, they've already
                walked it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I focused on learning React on his recommendation, as it gave me
                the best chances of employability. He also gave a list of books
                to read, the most immediately helpful was probably{" "}
                <a

                , which gives you a more bird's eye view of the language and
                some of its pitfalls.
            </p>
            <p>
                So off to work I went. You will probably find your first contact
                with React to be a bit weird. Same goes for other similar
                libraries and frameworks. So far you've been learning that the
                separation of concerns between HTML, CSS & JS is a big deal. You
                then get to the frameworks and all that goes out the window. Get
                in loser,{" "}

                It takes some adjustment and I found the official documentation
                on the philosophy of React to be helpful in figuring things out.

                Then I went back to what had worked before: Asabeneh's

                is less complete and by now probably outdated. Still, it was
                good enough to get me started and pass the fCC course materials.
                The final projects that fCC recommends were particularly
                important to affix everything into place, along with their take
                home projects under their interview prep materials.

                Then luck struck again and I managed to land my first job on the
                strength of a recommendation. I could see the light breaking
                through! I was finally out of the "Learn to Code" forest. This
                is also a lesson for everyone looking for an exit. Like in many
                other industries, no matter how good you are, how shiny your CV
                or how brilliant your portfolio, it really puts you ahead if you
                are personable.

                Hopefully things will change, but the entry positions weren't
                exactly falling from the trees when I got in, and even junior
                positions were regularly mobbed by hundreds of candidates. The
                best strategy is often to already have a good relationship with
                someone that can put in a good word on you behalf when something
                pops up.

                I empathize with all of you that prefer the company of your own
                thoughts. But in the context of coding, being sociable probably
                doesn't mean going out clubbing. You will be in the company of
                other technology loving nerds who, like you, enjoy discussing{" "}

                So join some groups, make some friends and don't hesitate to ask
                people for help or advice. Most are very friendly. I certainly
                lost a lot of time being stubborn and trying to do it all by
                myself. You never know when you will be chancing upon a life

                With this we arrive at the end of year 0, the time I spent lost
                in the cursed "Learn to Code" forest before getting my first job
                as a FE dev. What was on the other side of the forest? An
                adventure for another day. My Year 1. But if you thought
                starting to learn the stuff was a pain, be prepared for things
                to get even crazier.
